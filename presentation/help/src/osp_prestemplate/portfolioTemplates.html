If you are a site organizer, you can create templates that support the intended purpose(s) of portfolios on your site. You might create one template to support resumes or other forms of self-presentation. You might create another for displaying the results of teaching and learning as demonstrated in the contents of general education or co-curricular progress matrices. Or you might create a template that is tailored for assessment and accreditation portfolios, such as those that integrate learning across many data structures and sites to show learning in relation to institutional values or desired outcomes.</p><p>Site participants are not required to use templates for their portfolios. Within certain limits, they may also design their own portfolios.</p><p>Portfolio templates are best used when you, the site organizer, want to guide site participants in specific ways rather then allowing them to create portfolios according to their own ideas and specifications. The most effective way to work with portfolios and portfolio templates is use templates to guide and instruct participants in creating effective portfolios; then provide a variety of portfolio layouts and styles that allow participants more freedom in putting their own creativity into portfolios for similar or different purposes.</p><p>Each template is based on an .xsl file. This file specifies the layout for the portfolio, the pathways to the content for the portfolio, and, optionally, the pathway to a .css file that defines the portfolio style.</p><p>Optionally, a template can also include "outline options." These options allow participants to add content to their portfolios by keying or copying and pasting text directly into it. Outline options are often used when it is easier or more intuitive for participants to add content directly rather than creating each distinct item as a form in Resources. Outline options can be used to prompt for and collect information such as a site participant's name, a date, a title and subtitle for the portfolio, captions for images, and/or one or more reflections. They are also used when the participant needs to specify a particular level of a matrix to include in a portfolio. </p><p>Outline options are presented to the participant in aSAKAIscreen. You, the site organizer, define the fields on the screen (which is, essentially, a form) by adding an .xsd file for it to the template. </p><h2>The Portfolio Templates Tool and the Resources Tool</h2><p>If you are a site organizer, the Portfolio Templates tool allows you to add templates that define the content, style, and layout of portfolios created by your site participants. Each template is based on an .xsl file and may include other files, such as .css, .xsd, and javascript files. You must upload these files to Resources to make them available to the Portfolio Templates tool. </p><p>After adding a template, you may use this tool to perform any of the following activities.</p><ul><li>Change, and delete it. </li><li>Publish it so site participants can use it. </li><li>Create a new template by copying the template you added and changing the copy. </li><li>Use a template created in one site in another site by exporting it from the first site and importing it into the other.</li><li>Change Portfolio Templates tool permissions for all users in any given role.</li></ul><h2>Accessing the Portfolio Templates Tool</h2><p>The Portfolio Layouts tool is usually located in the Design & Publish category of a portfolio site.</p><p>To access the tool, click the Launch button for Portfolio Templates. Sakai displays the Portfolio Templates home page. </p><p>The screen contains a list of the portfolio templates on your site.  If the list is longer than one page, use the buttons under the Portfolio Templates menu bar to display other pages in the list. </p><ul><li>To display the first page of the list, click First.</li><li>To display the previous page of the list, click Previous.</li><li>To display the next page of the list, click Next.</li><li>To display the last page of the list, click Last.</li></ul><h2>Preparing to Create a Template</h2><p>Before creating a template, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the forms, layouts, and styles that your institution has created. Then carefully consider the following questions and take appropriate action.</p><ul><li>What are the objectives of the type(s) of portfolios that will be based on this template?</li><li>What content must be included to achieve these objectives?</li><li>In what order should content be presented?</li><li>If your institution has existing portfolio layouts, which of those layouts is best suited to portfolios built on this template? Upload the appropriate .xsl file to Resources. If you do not have an appropriate layout file at your disposal, upload passthrough.xsl to Resources. This file is available at \webapps\osp-portal\WEB-INF\transform and in the Downloads/OSP section of rSmart's RSN. </li><li>Do users need to enter additional information such as a portfolio title and subtitle and/or captions for images? Do they need to select a single level of a matrix to include in the portfolio? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, in what file are these options available? Upload the appropriate .xsd file to Resources and make note of its root node.</li><li>Your institution has a default "style" that includes a standard set of fonts, colors, and so forth. If your institution has created other styles as well, which style is best suited for portfolios built on this template? Upload the appropriate .css file to Resources. Make note of the name for this file that is used in the layout (.xsl) file you have chosen.</li><li>What other files do you need to use in this template? You may include image, sound, video, javascript, and other types of files. Upload the appropriate files to Resources and make note of the name for each file as given in the layout (.xsl) file you have chosen. </li></ul><h2>Creating a Template</h2><p>Creating a template involves multiple steps:</p><ol><li>Add the name for the template to Sakai.</li><li>Specify the layout for it.</li><li>Add the required forms.</li><li>Select supporting files.</li><li>If you have based the template on passthrough.xsl, create an .xsl transformation file and add it to the template.</li></ol><h3>Step 1: Adding the Template Name</h3> <p>To give the template a name, access the Portfolios Templates tool and follow these steps:</p><ol><li>If the Portfolio Templates home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li><li>In the Portfolio Templates menu bar near the top of the screen, click the Add button.
