Portfolios serve real-world purposes, such as career development and job search, documentation of and reflection on experience and learning, and collaboration. For example, you might create a portfolio for your resume or curriculum vita. You might also make a portfolio to showcase art, writing, or other talents and skills you have developed. Other uses of portfolios include collaboratively reporting on group projects and presenting learning you have demonstrated in matrices or wizards. These are just a few of the many ways people have used online portfolios. </p><p>To create and work with a portfolio in Sakai, you use both the Resources tool and the Portfolios tool. First, you collect the material you want to present in Resources. Then you use the Portfolios tool to present the information.</p><p>The Portfolios tool allows you to do all of the following:</p><ul><li>Choose material for your presentation by selecting forms, matrices, uploaded files, and URLs from your Resources.</li><li>Design your own portfolio presentation by selecting from layouts and text/color/display styles made available to you by your institution. Alternatively, you may base your presentation on a template made available to you by your institution. Templates are especially helpful for more elaborate portfolios.</li></ul><p>At your institution, some styles, layouts, and templates may be available only to a specific site, while others are available to all sites. Therefore, users working in different sites may have access to different styles, layouts, and templates.</p><ul><li>Publish portfolio presentations for audiences of your choosing. Your audience may include both site participants and people who are not members of the site.</li><li>Notify others that a portfolio has been shared with them.</li><li>Change, comment on, and delete your portfolios. </li><li>Invite comments on your portfolios and view and manage comments received. </li><li>View and comment on other participants' portfolios. View comments you have made about these portfolios.</li><li>View statistics on who has accessed your portfolios.</li><li>Download a copy of a portfolio to your desktop.</li></ul><h2>Planning a Portfolio</h2><p>Before creating a portfolio, we recommend that you carefully consider the following questions and take appropriate action.</p><ul><li>What is the objective of this portfolio?</li><li>What content do I need to include in order to achieve this objective? What specific word-processing, spreadsheet, image, and other files do I need? After answering these questions, store the files you plan to use in Resources. For information on adding items to Resources</li><li>What additional information (context, explanation, and so forth) do I need to provide? </li><li>In what order do I want to present the material? </li><li>How much creative control do I want to have over the appearance of the portfolio? Would I rather use a template that controls the layout and text/color/display style of the entire portfolio or design my own approach by selecting from a set of predefined layouts and styles? In order to answer these questions, we recommend that you review all appropriate templates, layouts, and styles that your institution has made available for your use.</li><li>If I plan to design my own approach, will the presentation be more effective if I use the same layout on each web page or if the layout changes from page to page? You may choose a different layout for each page or use the same layout for all pages in your presentation.</li><li>Based on the layout(s) I have chosen, how many web pages will be required?  </li><li>If I plan to design my own approach, will the presentation be more effective if I use the same set of fonts, text colors and sizes, spacing, and background colors for all pages? Or should the text display and background change from page to page? Your institution has a default "style" that includes a standard set of fonts, colors, and so forth. If your institution has created other styles as well, you may choose between them for each page or you may choose to use a single style for the entire presentation.</li></ul><h2>Accessing the Portfolios Tool</h2><p>The Portfolios tool is usually located in the Design & Publish category. To access the tool, open that category and click the Launch button for Portfolios. Sakai displays the Portfolios home page. </p><p>This page contains a list of all portfolios on the site that you have permission to view. If the list is longer than one page, use the buttons under the Portfolios menu bar to display other pages in the list. </p><ul><li>To display the first page of the list, click First.</li><li>To display the previous page of the list, click Previous.</li><li>To display the next page of the list, click Next.</li><li>To display the last page of the list, click Last.</li></ul><h2>Creating a Portfolio</h2> <p>The process of creating a portfolio involves selecting items from Resources, giving the portfolio a name and an optional expiration date, deciding whether or not to allow comments, determining which site participants or users outside the site will have access to the portfolio, deciding whether or not to make the portfolio public, and optionally notifying others that a portfolio has been shared with them.</p><p>To create a portfolio, access the Portfolios tool and follow these steps:</p><ol><li>If the Portfolios home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li><li>In the Portfolios menu bar near the top of the screen, click the Add button.
