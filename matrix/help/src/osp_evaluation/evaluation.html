If you are an evaluator, you use this tool to access the appropriate part of a participant's wizard or matrix, review the work shown there, and provide an evaluation of it.</p><p>As an evaluator, you enter your ratings and comments in an evaluation form. This form is created by the site organizer. By carefully designing evaluation forms for wizard pages and matrix cells, the site organizer can incorporate your institution's existing evaluation practices and assessment rubrics, such as evaluation scales and prompts for subjective evaluation, into the process of evaluating wizards and matrices.</p><p><i>To ensure effective reporting and avoid confusion, we strongly recommended that your institution standardize evaluation scales across all wizard pages and matrix cells and across all wizards and matrices.</i></p><p>After you have evaluated a page or cell, your ratings and comments are available to the participant whose work you have evaluated. Your evaluation is also available to other site members who have permission to evaluate or review the page or cell.</p><p>The home page contains a list of participant work that is ready to be evaluated. For each title, the list contains its owner (if you have permission to see the name of the owner), the date the work was submitted, and whether the work is contained in a matrix cell or wizard page. </p><p>If the list is longer than one page, use the buttons near the top of the screen to find the item you want.</p><ul><li>To display the first page of the list, click First.</li><li>To display the previous page of the list, click Previous.</li><li>To display the next page of the list, click Next.</li><li>To display the last page of the list, click Last.</li></ul><h2>Evaluations: Evaluating Submitted Work</h2><p>To review submitted work, access the Evaluations tool and follow these steps:</p><ol><li>If the Evaluations home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li><li>Click the desired title in the list. Sakai displays the appropriate matrix cell or wizard page for the title you have selected. </li><li>Review the instructions and all forms and other attachments that have been submitted.<i>Note: To return to the Evaluations home page at any time, click the Reset button.</i></li><li>In the Evaluation section, click the Add Evaluation link.</li><li>Complete the boxes in the form. Be sure to enter a title for your evaluation. This entry is required. </li><li>To add your comments, click the Add button. Sakai attaches your comments to the participant's wizard page or matrix cell and redisplays the Evaluations home page. Or, to return to that page without attaching comments, click Cancel.</li></ol><h2>Evaluations: Changing Permissions</h2><p>Permissions are more complex for evaluators than for most other site members. In order for you to act as an evaluator of work in a specific matrix cell or wizard page, the following conditions must be met:</p><ul><li>You must be assigned the role of evaluator on this site.  </li><li>On the specific matrix cell or wizard page, your role or your user name must be specified as an evaluator.</li><li>Your role must have "evaluate" permission in both the Matrices or Wizards tool and the Evaluations tool</li></ul><p>To change the default permissions for the Evaluations tool, access the tool and follow these steps:</p><ol><li>If the Evaluations menu bar is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li><li>Click the Permissions button on the menu bar. Sakai displays the Permissions screen.</li><li>Referring to the table below, check boxes to select the appropriate permissions for users in each role.<br/><br/><table border="1"><tr><th>Permission</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>View Owner</td><td>Users in this role may see the name of the user whose work is being evaluated in a matrix cell or wizard page. </td></tr><tr><td>Evaluate</td><td>Users in this role may review site participants' finished work in matrices and wizards and offer summative feedback on it. </td></tr></table><br/></li><li>To save the permissions settings, click save. Sakai saves the settings and displays the Evaluations home page. Or, to return to that screen without saving your changes, click cancel.</li></ol></div></body></html>
