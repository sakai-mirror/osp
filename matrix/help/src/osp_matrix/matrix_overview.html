<h2>Matrices: Overview</h2>

<p>A matrix is a type of wizard. The Glossary tool provides context and definitions for the criteria and levels in a matrix.</p>

<p>A matrix is a type of wizard that provides structure and guidance for any learning process that can be organized into two dimensions - rows and columns. Matrices track progress across criteria, milestones, or standards (the rows) in relation to different activities or levels (the columns).</p>

<p>Matrices allow site participants to provide evidence of learning or other achievements in criteria, standards, or skills according to different levels of ability or areas of activity. They can be used to document learning or achievements in many areas - general education, co-curricular development, program requirements, course activities, graduation standards, faculty promotion and tenure, and more.</p>

<p>Within a matrix, the intersection of each row and column forms a cell. The cell's content provides a means of tracking achievement, encouraging reflection on the learning experience, and providing feedback and evaluation.</p>

<p>Each cell presents participants with instructions, samples, and forms to be completed, along with informational files, URLs, and/or other materials. Participants complete the forms that are presented and provide evidence from Resources to document their learning or achievement in relation to the criterion and level for this cell. Participants also reflect upon that evidence according to prompts provided in the cell. </p>

<p>Site organizers guide participants through the activities for each cell. To provide this guidance, they supply instructions, rationale, and examples in the cell. They may also include forms that structure participant evidence of learning or achievement. Additionally, they provide forms that prompt participants to reflect upon their evidence, forms in which designated reviewers provide feedback on participant progress, and forms in which designated evaluators offer their evaluation of the work after a participant submits the cell. Finally, site organizers may also determine the order in which participants complete the cells.  </p>

<p>As a site organizer, you can create portfolio templates to display the content of a completed matrix or a matrix in process. Through these templates, you can allow site participants to transform their matrices into portfolios.</p>

<p>If you are a system administrator or a site organizer, you can use the Matrices tool to perform the following activities. </p>
<ul>
<li>Create, change, and delete matrices. </li>
<li>Publish a matrix so that site participants can use it.
<i>Do NOT publish a matrix until it is exactly the way you want it.</i></li>
<li>Use a matrix created in one site in another site by exporting it from the first site and importing it into the other site.</li>
<li>Change Matrices tool permissions for all users in any given role.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are a site participant, you use the tool to complete matrices.  </p>

<p>The Matricies home page contains a list of matrices for the site. For each matrix, the list contains its name, description, and owner and indicates whether it has been published. 
If the list of matrices is longer than one page, use the buttons under the Matrices menu bar to display other pages in the list.</p>

<ul>
<li>To display the first page of the list, click First.</li>
<li>To display the previous page of the list, click Previous.</li>
<li>To display the next page of the list, click Next.</li>
<li>To display the last page of the list, click Last.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Designing a Matrix</h2>

<p>Many of the guidelines that apply to designing any other type of wizard also apply to designing a matrix. 
Avoid unnecessary complexity!
You can add unlimited instructions, forms, feedback, evaluation, and other features to each cell of a matrix. As a result, it's possible to make a matrix overly complex and difficult or burdensome to use. Remember this: You do not have to use every element and feature at every opportunity. If something seems to have little or no value at any point, leave it out. </p>

<p>To design a matrix, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analyze the activity or process that the matrix will support. </li>
<li>Identify the rows and columns you will need.  </li>
<li>Identify the content needed (instructions, files, forms, etc.) for each cell of the matrix and for the matrix as a whole. </li>
<li>Draw a diagram showing the organization of the matrix's components.<br/>
<i><u>Do NOT omit this step:</u>
Because matrices are fairly complex and many aspects of them cannot be changed after publication, we strongly recommend that you diagram the matrix and the contents of each cell before creating them in the Matrices tool. </i>
</li>
<li>If you plan to attach files to provide information to users of the matrix, create those files and store them in Resources.</li>
<li>Identify the points at which formative and summative feedback are needed. You may allow for feedback on the matrix as a whole or cell by cell. Before making decisions in this regard, think carefully about the load placed on reviewers (those who provide formative feedback) and evaluators (those who provide summative feedback). Also, keep in mind that after a cell or a matrix has been submitted for evaluation, participants can no longer change it. </li>
<li>Identify people to provide formative and summative feedback. Be sure they have appropriate permissions.</li>
<li>If you plan to use forms in the matrix to provide structure for site participant work, reflection prompts, and review and evaluation of work in the cells, store the .xsd files for those forms in Resources.</li>
<li>In most cases, it is good practice to use a single style throughout a matrix. If you plan to use a style other than the default, store the .css file for it in Resources and use the Styles tool to create the style.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Creating a Matrix</h2>

<p>Creating a matrix involves multiple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating a framework for the matrix.</li>
<li>Setting up the cells.</li>
<li>Publishing the matrix.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 1: Creating the Framework</h3>

<p>To create the framework for a matrix, access the Matrices tool and follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the Matrices home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li>

<li>In the Matrices menu bar near the top of the screen, click the Add button. Sakai displays the Add Matrix screen.</li>

<li>In the appropriate boxes, enter a title for the matrix and a description of its purpose. Only the Title entry is required. 
<i>Caution: Choose the title carefully. After publishing a matrix, you cannot change its title.</i>
</li>

<li>Choose one of the following options:</li>

<ul>
<li>To apply Sakai's default style to this matrix, skip this step and proceed directly to step 6. </li>
<li>To apply another style to this matrix, click Select Style. Sakai displays the Manage Styles screen. </li>
This screen lists the styles available for use in your matrices. 
</ul>

<li>Click the Select link for the style you want to apply to this matrix. Sakai redisplays the Add Matrix screen. The name of the style you chose is displayed in the Style box. Or, to return to that screen without selecting a style, click Go Back.</li>

<li>To add a column, click Add Column. Sakai displays the Editing Scaffold Column screen.</li>

<li>In the Name box, enter a name for display in the column header. Keep in mind that shorter names for columns allow for better use of screen space.</li>

<li>To select a background color for this column other than the default (gray), click the color palette icon for the Background Color box. When Sakai displays color choices, click the background color you want. </li>

<li>To select a color for the text in this column other than the default (black), click the color palette icon for the Font Color box. When Sakai displays color choices, click the text color you want. </li>

<li>To save your work on this column, click Update. Sakai displays the Add Matrix screen, including information for the column you have just created. Or to return to the Add Matrix screen without adding this column, click Cancel.</li>

<li>Repeat steps 6 - 10 as needed to create the remaining columns for your matrix. 
<i>Caution: Think carefully about the number of columns in the matrix. After publishing a matrix, you cannot change the number of columns it contains.</i>
</li>

<li>To change terminology to something other than the word "Column," enter the term you prefer in the Column Label box.</li>

<li>To add a row, click Add Row. Sakai displays the Editing Scaffold Row screen.</li>

<li>In the Name box, enter a name for display in the row header.</li>

<li>To select a background color for this row other than the default (gray), click the color palette icon for the Background Color box. When Sakai displays color choices, click the background color you want. </li>

<li>To select a color for the text in this row other than the default (black), click the color palette icon for the Font Color box. When Sakai displays color choices, click the text color you want. </li>

<li>To save your work on this row, click Update. Sakai displays the Add Matrix screen, including information for the row you have just created.
Or to return to the Add Matrix screen without adding this row, click Cancel.
</li>

<li>Repeat steps 13 - 17 as needed to create the remaining rows for the matrix.
<i>Caution: Think carefully about the number of rows in the matrix. After publishing a matrix, you cannot change the number of rows it contains.</i>
</li>


<li>To change terminology to something other than the word "Row," enter the term you prefer in the Row Label box.</li>

<li>Under Matrix Presentation, click the appropriate radio button to select the way you want participants to work through the cells in the matrix.</li>

<li>Under Matrix Status Colors, select colors to indicate the status of each cell in the matrix. <br/>
<br/>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Status</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ready</td>
<td>This cell is available for site participant work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pending</td>
<td>The participant has submitted this cell for evaluation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Completed</td>
<td>This cell has been evaluated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Locked</td>
<td>This cell is not available for site participant work at this time.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br/>
</li>

<li>To save your work, click Save Changes. Or, to exit without adding a new matrix, click Cancel.<br/>

If you clicked Save Changes, Sakai saves your changes and displays the new matrix on the Revise Matrix screen. <br>

Note the following:
<ul>
<li>The matrix title you specified in step 3 is displayed in the top left corner of the table. If you entered a description in that step, it is displayed above the table.</li>
<li>The column names, background colors, and text colors you entered in steps 6 - 11 are displayed in the column headers. </li>
<li>The row names and colors you entered in steps 13 - 18 are displayed in the row headers.</li>
<li>The legend shows the colors you selected to indicate various states. </li>
<li>In this example, all cells of the matrix are green, indicating (according to the legend) that they are ready for use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 2: Setting up Cells</h3>

<p>To set up cells for a matrix, access the Matrices tool and follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the Matrices home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li>

<li>Find the matrix you want to work on and click the Revise link beneath its name. Sakai displays the Revise Matrix screen. </li>
<li>Click the desired cell.
<ul>
<li>Sakai displays the Revise Cell screen. </li>
<li>Sakai has automatically entered a title for this cell. The default title includes the name of both the column and row that intersect at this cell.  </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Change the title of the cell, if needed. An entry in the Title box is required. </li>
<li>Enter a description (objectives, etc.) of the cell, if needed. </li>
<li>In the Initial Status box, select either Ready or Locked to indicate whether this cell is to be available to participants as soon as the matrix is published. </li>
<li>To apply a style to this cell, see "Step 1: Creating the Framework," step 4, above.</li>
<li>Add the following as needed:</li>
<ul>
<li>Forms for structuring site participant work in this cell.</li>
<li>Instructions, rationale, and examples of work relevant to this cell, including uploaded files.</li>
<li>Forms for collecting participant reflections on their work in this cell.</li>
<li>Forms for structuring reviewer feedback on participant work in this cell.</li>
<li>Forms for evaluation of work after this cell has been submitted for evaluation.</li>
<li>Names of evaluators</li>
</ul>
<li>To save your work, click Save Changes. Sakai displays the Revise Matrix screen. Or, to return to this screen without saving your entries, click Cancel.</li>

<li>To set up other cells in the matrix, repeat steps 3- 9. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 3: Publishing the Matrix</h3>

<p>Publishing a matrix makes it available for use by site participants. To publish a matrix, access the Matrices tool and follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the Matrices home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li>

<li>Find the matrix you want to work on and click the Publish link beneath its name. Sakai displays the Revise Matrix screen. </li>

<h2>For Site Participants: Completing a Matrix</h2>

<p>A matrix is a table of columns and rows that contains a customized collection of instructions, forms, files, and other materials. The purpose of these materials is to guide you through learning activities. These activities often take place over a long period of time. Therefore, you may need to access a matrix many times in order to complete it.</p>

<p>To complete part of a matrix (each part of the table is called a "cell"), you access it online, follow the instructions you find there, record information and attach requested materials, reflect on your activities, and receive feedback. </p>

<p>After collecting samples of your work in a matrix, Sakai allows you to create a portfolio to showcase them.
To access a matrix and work in one or more of its cells, access the Matrices tool and follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the Matrices home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li>

<li>Click the name of the matrix you want to work with. Sakai displays the matrix you have chosen.The name of the matrix is shown in the upper left corner of the table.  The intersection of each column and row forms a cell. Within each cell are instructions for you to follow in order to demonstrate a specific level of competence in a particular area.<br/>

As shown in the legend beneath the table, each cell is color coded to indicate its status.<br/>
<ul>
<li>Ready: This cell is available for you to work on.</li>
<li>Pending: You have submitted your work in this cell for evaluation.</li>
<li>Completed: You have received an evaluation of your work in this cell and are not required to perform any additional work.</li>
<li>Locked: This cell is not yet available for you to work on.</li>
