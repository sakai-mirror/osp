The simplest type is a sequential wizard. This kind of wizard is well suited to activities in which a series of steps are performed in a linear fashion. For example, you might create a sequential wizard to guide students through the steps of creating a term paper or to guide students though an experiment that extends over a significant period of time. A wizard for an experiment might track the timing of each step, collect data and interpretations from students at critical points, and provide an opportunity for you or others to provide feedback along the way.</p><p>The second type of wizard is hierarchical. A hierarchical wizard presents forms and information as a set of categories and subcategories, much as an outline presents nested information. Hierarchical wizards are helpful when organizing and tracking activities in multiple arenas, each of which has unique milestones. You might create a hierarchical wizard to track personal, academic, occupational, and extracurricular activities for use by academic or career advisors or for use in developing resumes.</p><p>The third type of wizard is a matrix wizard. Also called a matrix, this wizard presents forms and information in a set of rows and columns. You might create a matrix to track progress across different disciplines (the rows) that have similar milestones (the columns). Each cell in the matrix is a point at which you can track achievements, encourage reflection on how the disciplines mesh, and provide feedback. </p><h3>Who Uses Wizards</h3><p>In the out-of-the-box version of Sakai, any site participant can build a wizard in My Workspace. Most often, however, instructors and site organizers create and share wizards with site participants in portfolio, course, and project sites. After a wizard has been published, users in many roles may access it. </p><p>et's say you are an academic advisor and you have created a wizard in a portfolio site for use in tracking student progress in a specific program. Each student in the program accesses your wizard to complete forms, attach files as evidence of work completed, reflect on learning, etc. Reviewers and evaluators (who you identify when you create the wizard) also access the wizard to review work and add comments at key points and/or after the entire wizard has been completed. </p><h3>Components of Wizards</h3><p>A wizard is made up of one or more units known as pages. Each page can contain many different components. These components can include instructions or general guidance to the user, an introduction to or rationale for the page, examples to help participants understand how to use the wizard, forms for people in various roles to complete (including, if desired, forms that solicit reflection or other feedback), and/or items from Resources. </p><p>To build an effective wizard, you use XSD programming and the Forms tool to create forms. The forms you create allow you to structure and collect information, such as reflections on learning and feedback and evaluation of the work shown in the wizard. These forms may apply to the wizard as a whole and/or to each page of the wizard. You may also use a .css file to create a display style for the wizard. </p><h2>Accessing the Wizards Tool</h2><p>The Wizards tool allows you to create, change, publish, import, and export wizards. This tool is usually located in the Collect & Reflect category on a portfolio site, in the Guide & Instruct category on a course site, and in the Collaborate category on a project site. </p><p>To access the tool, click the Launch button for Wizards. Sakai displays the Wizards home page.</p><p>The home page is also known as the Wizard Manager screen. It contains a list of the wizards you have created. For each wizard, you can see its name, a short description of its purpose, its status (published or unpublished), its type (sequential or hierarchical), the number of pages that have been submitted by all participants for evaluation, the total number of pages in the wizard, and the date it was last accessed. </p><h2>Designing a Wizard</h2><p><i>Avoid unnecessary complexity:</i>You can add unlimited instructions, forms, feedback, evaluation, and other features to each page of a wizard. You can also create an unlimited number of pages, categories, and subcategories. As a result, it's possible to make a wizard overly complex and difficult or burdensome to use. Remember this: You do not have to use every element and feature at every opportunity. If something seems to have little or no value at any point, leave it out. </p> <p>Wizards can be very simple or quite complex. For all but the most straightforward situations, we recommend that you design your wizard before creating it in Sakai. To design a wizard, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Analyze the activity or process that the wizard will support. Identify the type of wizard that will best support it.</li><li>If you plan to create a hierarchical wizard, identify the categories and subcategories you will need. You may want to consider creating a category for each distinct path or grouping of activities. You may find it helpful to draw a high-level diagram of the wizard's organization.</li><li>Identify the pages you will need. You may want to consider creating a page for each step that requires different guidance, produces a different work product, or takes place at a different time. </li><li>Identify the content needed (instructions, files, forms, etc.) for each page and - if the wizard contains more than one page - for the wizard as a whole. You may find it helpful to draw a diagram showing the organization of the wizard's components. </li><li>If you plan to attach files to provide information to users of the wizard, create those files and store them in Resources.</li><li>Identify the points at which formative and summative feedback are needed. You may allow for feedback on the wizard as a whole or on a page-by-page basis. Before making decisions in this regard, think carefully about the load placed on reviewers (those who provide formative feedback) and evaluators (those who provide summative feedback). Also, keep in mind that after a page or a wizard has been submitted for evaluation, participants can no longer change it. </li><li>Identify people to provide formative and summative feedback. Be sure they have appropriate permissions. For more information on setting permissions for reviewers, see "Changing Permissions for the Wizards Tool".</li><li>If you plan to use forms for users to use in responding to instructions on a wizard page and/or for collecting comments from reviewers and evaluators, create those forms and store the .xsd files for them in Resources. Forms for collecting reflections and feedback comments may be added to the wizard as a whole or to individual pages. Forms for participants to use in following the instructions for completing a wizard can be added only to individual pages, not to the wizard as a whole. </li><li>Choose the style(s) you want to use in the wizard. In most cases, it is good practice to use a single style throughout a wizard. If you plan to use a style other than the default, store the .css file for it in Resources and use the Styles tool to create the style. </li></ol><h2>Building a Wizard</h2><p>To build a matrix wizard, use the Matrices tool.</p> <p>To build a sequential or hierarchical wizard, access the Wizards tool and follow these steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Creating the Wizard</h3><ol><li>If the Wizards menu bar is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li><li>Click the Add button on the menu bar. Sakai displays the Add screen.</li><li>Select the type of wizard you are creating by clicking the button for either sequential or hierarchical. </li><li>To proceed, click Continue. Or, to return to the Wizards home page without creating a wizard, click Cancel.</li>If you clicked Continue, Sakai displays the Add Wizard, Step 1, screen.<li>Using the boxes shown, enter a name, a description of the wizard's purpose, and keywords. Only the Name entry is required. </li><li>Choose one of the following options:<ul><li>To apply Sakai's default style to this wizard, skip this step and proceed directly to step 7. </li><li>To apply another style to this wizard, click Select Style. Sakai displays the Manage Styles screen. This screen lists the styles available for use in your wizards. Click the Select link for the style you want to apply to this wizard.

Proceed as instructed in steps 2 and 3. </li><li>To add a form with which to collect participant reflections upon their work in the wizard, select the appropriate form from the Reflection pulldown list.</li><li>To add a form in which reviewers will provide formative feedback to participants, select the appropriate form from the Feedback pulldown list.</li><li>To add a form in which reviewers will provide summative feedback to participants, select the appropriate form from the Evaluation pulldown list. If you want participants to be able to modify their responses indefinitely, do not include an evaluation form and do not identify evaluators for the wizard. In the absence of evaluation form and an evaluator to provide summative feedback, the wizard has no end point, so participants can return to it and change it as desired.</li><li>To select people to provide summative feedback, click Select Evaluators. Sakai displays the Select Evaluators screen. The window on the left side of the screen lists all roles defined for this site. Below the line, it also lists all site participants. </li><li>To select evaluators, click the names of roles and/or individuals and then click the Add button. The roles you have selected for evaluators must have permission to evaluate wizards. Furthermore, the individuals selected for evaluation must be assigned a role selected for evaluation in the site. If these conditions are not met, the selected users will not be able to view and evaluate wizards. For more information on setting permissions, "Changing Permissions for the Wizards Tool".
