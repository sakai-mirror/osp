By doing so, it compensates for the limited space allowed for row and column names. </p><p>When participants move the mouse over a row or column name in a matrix, Sakai displays a short definition or explanation that has been entered via the Glossary tool. When participants click on the name, it hyperlinks to more extensive information of the site organizer's choosing. Site organizers often use these hyperlinks to provide detailed information on objectives, outcomes, or standards represented by each criterion; a complete list of campus activities for each category; or an extensive grouping of resources to develop each skill.</p><p>If you are a system administrator or an instructor, the Glossary tool allows you to create the short and long definitions and explanations described above. If you are a system administrator, you may also make glossary terms global. In this case, the terms will be displayed in all sites that use the Glossary tool in this Sakai instance.  </p><p>This tool also allows you to manage glossary terms in other ways. You may:</p><ul><li>Change glossary terms.</li><li>Delete glossary terms.</li><li>Use a glossary created in one site in another site by exporting it from the first site and importing to the other site.</li><li>Change Glossary tool permissions for all users in any given role.</li><li>The Glossary tool is usually located in the Guide category on the portfolio web site. </li></ul><p>To access the Glossary tool, click the Launch button for Glossary. Sakai displays the Glossary home page.</p><p?The home page contains a list of glossary terms in alphabetical order, along with their short definitions. You have several options for viewing the glossary:</p><ul><li>To see the long definition or description of a term, click the term itself. Sakai displays the longer hyperlinked definition in a separate window. To close the window, click Close.</li><li>To display the first page of terms, click First.</li><li>To display the previous page of terms, click Previous.</li><li>To display the next page of terms, click Next.</li><li>To display the last page of terms, click Last.</li></ul><h2>Adding a Glossary Term</h2><p>To add a term to the glossary, access the Glossary tool and follow these steps:</p><ol><li>If you do not see the Glossary menu bar, click the Reset button.</li><li>Click the Add link on the menu bar.

Sakai deletes the term from the list. </li></ol><p>Sakai does not display a warning message before deleting the term.

Because you are working in the PortfolioAdmin site, Sakai makes this term available to all sites. </li></ol><h2>Exporting and Importing a Glossary</h2><p>If you own more than one site, you may want to use the same glossary in two or more of them. To do so, first export the glossary to your desktop as a compressed file first and then import it to the other site(s) where you plan to use it.</p><h3>Exporting a Glossary </h3><p>To export a glossary as a compressed file, access the Glossary tool on the appropriate site and follow these steps:</p><ol><li>If you do not see the Glossary menu bar, click the Reset button.</li><li>Click the Export link on the menu bar.

Sakai imports the file, adds the terms to the glossary, and displays the Glossary home page. Or, to return to the home page without importing the file, click Cancel. </li></ol><h2>Changing Permissions for the Glossary Tool</h2><p>All participants who work with a matrix are permitted to display glossary definitions for row and column names. However, permissions to add, delete, change, and export glossary terms can be restricted by role, just as they can in other tools in Sakai. </p><p>To assign permissions, access the Glossary tool and follow these steps:</p><ol><li>If you do not see the Glossary menu bar, click the Reset button.</li><li>Click the Permissions link on the menu bar.
