 *   These are the permissions for reporting.  Reporting uses the sakai permission manager
 *   and not the osp permission manager.  Meta object uses the sakai permission manager as well.
 *   The labels on the page are drawn from the function string minus the prefix.
 *   
 *   Apparently, when labelling a permission with more than one word, then a period is used as 
 *   the spacer.
